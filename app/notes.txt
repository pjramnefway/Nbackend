flow
------
i am building this application for coporate_employees & cabs & drivers here my main aim is to get all the details from driver like complete verfication is done from our side(company)
1.life insurance will be provided once the driver completes 6 months of his journey with company()
there are total 6 type of employees are there for this application 
4 admins
2 employees

admins
-------
company_admin(nefway_admin)
super_coporate_admin
coporate_admin
vendor_admin

employees
---------
coporate_employee 
vendor_employee or vendor_cabs

nefway_admin adds super_coporate_admin
super_coporate_admin will add coporate_admin & vendor_admin

company_admin will add employees from multiple companies

vendor_admin will add cabs/drivers from multiple travel agencies


i am follwoing the mvc pattern folde structure to seperate the code as per the db,middleware,frontend & routes

models
-------
database logic

views
------
there is no frontend here for this purpose we use ejs as frontend to see the o/p 

controller
----------
backend logic 


adminLogin
-----------
they can login based on role(nefway_admin,super_coporate_admin,coporate_admin,vendor_admin,employees,vendor_cabs_employee)

there is no register because their ids will be created manually & give the credentials to all of them  then we can able to login 




admin table 
------------
i have created same table for all admins(users)

super_coporate_admin
----------------------
i have created table in db super_coporate_admin
